Building a Release
==================

We have switched to building with cibuildwheel and build. You'll need docker installed and working.
In a venv, install the required packages:

    > pip install twine build cibuildwheel

Build the source distribution:

    > python -m build

Build the wheels:

    > cibuildwheel

The cibuildwheel process is long. First the required docker images are obtained/updated,
then a matrix of builds is performed.

Move the sdist and wheels to a common folder and upload to pypi with twine. Twine needs an API key.
Upload to the test repository first and confirm everything works as expected:

    twine upload --repository testpypi wheelhouse/*

If happy, upload to the main pypi repository:

    twine upload wheelhouse/*
